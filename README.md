I've used Django for this project.
Made an API using django rest-framework by which I was able to use the data from the database in front-end.
sqlite3 is the database used which the default database of Django.
Serialization is used by which we can easily communicate with the database.
Models.py consists of two models (Data and Image_Details)
Packages used:
  1.pillow for image processing 
  2.form xml.etree.ElementTree for parse the data from xml file 
  3.django rest_framework for creating api(pip install djangorestframework)
use the following command to run the code on your system
  - python manage.py runserver OR python3 manage.py runserver (based on what version is installed on your system)
